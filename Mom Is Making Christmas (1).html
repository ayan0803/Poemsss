    <h3><pre>
Cookies baking in the kitchen,
The smell floats through the air;
Mom is making Christmas
with her usual merry flair

The house she gaily decorated,
Each gift she stitched with love,
And we will gather around the Christmas tree
for an evening of old-fashioned fun

This evening she will sing a carol for us
With her angel is voice.
Yes, Mom is making Christmas,
A true reason to rejoice.
