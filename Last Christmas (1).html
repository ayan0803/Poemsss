Ah, aha
Ooh, ohh
Ohh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special
Someone
