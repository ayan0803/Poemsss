    <h3><pre>
Whenever I see girls and boys selling lanterns on the street
I remember the child in the manger as he sleeps
Wherever there are people giving gifts, exchanging cards
I believe that Christmas is truly in their hearts

Let's light our Christmas trees for a bright tomorrow
Where nations are at peace, and all are one in God

Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
This season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts

In every prayer and every song the community unites
Celebrating the birth of our savior Jesus Christ
Let love like that starlight on that first Christmas morn
Lead us back to the manger where Christ the child was born

So come let us rejoice, come and sing the Christmas carol
With one big joyful voice proclaim the name of the Lord

Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
This season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts

Let's sing Merry Christmas and a happy holiday
The season may we never forget the love we have for Jesus
Let him be the one to guide us as another new year starts
And may the spirit of Christmas be always in our hearts
